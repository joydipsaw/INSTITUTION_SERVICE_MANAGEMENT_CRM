# INSTITUTION_SERVICE_MANAGEMENT_CRM

Project Overview: 
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive CRM application for managing the services provided by an institution. The system will help improve the institution's operational efficiency by organizing client interactions and service requests in a centralized database. By automating workflows and enhancing visibility into service status, the CRM will help improve service quality, reduce delays, and offer a better experience for both clients and staff.

Objectives: 
Centralized Client and Service Request Management: All client and service data will be consolidated into one system, ensuring ease of access and preventing information silos.
Workflow Automation: Key service-related tasks such as creating service records, notifying clients, and assigning service agents will be automated to ensure smooth service delivery.
Data Analytics and Reporting: The application will provide actionable insights through reports and dashboards, enabling managers to assess service performance and take steps to address issues.

Project Features:
Account and Client Data Management: The system will store all necessary client and institutional account information, making it easier to track interactions and maintain strong relationships.
Service Request Tracking: Clients can submit requests for services, which will be automatically tracked from submission to completion, ensuring accountability.
Automation of Key Processes: Automated flows will handle routine tasks like service request status updates, task assignments, and email notifications, helping to eliminate bottlenecks and reduce human errors.
Reporting and Dashboards: The system will allow managers to monitor performance with real-time reports on service requests, response times, and client feedback.

Technology Stack:
Salesforce CRM: The backbone of the project, utilizing standard objects (Accounts, Contacts) and custom objects to represent services and service requests.
Process Automation (Lightning Flow): Flows will automate service assignments and notifications, ensuring a smooth operational workflow.
Apex: This will be used for writing custom business logic when required, such as complex triggers or calculations.
Lightning Web Components (LWC): For building intuitive and dynamic custom UI components to enhance the user experience.

Project Timeline:
Phase 1: 
Data Model Design and Object Setup – Define all necessary objects and their relationships (e.g., clients, service requests).

Phase 2:
 	Automating Processes – Create validation rules, flows, and process automation to streamline service operations.

Phase 3: 
UI Customization – Design Lightning Pages and build custom UI components using Lightning Web Components.

Phase 4: 
Testing and Deployment – Perform thorough testing of the CRM system, fix bugs, and deploy it for end-users.

Expected Outcomes: The CRM will enable the institution to:
Better Manage Client Interactions: With all client and service-related data centralized, the institution will have full visibility into its client base and service performance.
Automate Routine Operations: Manual tasks such as service tracking and client communication will be handled by automated flows, freeing up time for staff to focus on more important tasks.
Improve Service Delivery: By tracking requests and automating workflows, the system will ensure faster and more efficient handling of client requests, leading to increased satisfaction.
